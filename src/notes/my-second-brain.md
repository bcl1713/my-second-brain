## Step 1: Set Up the Basic Next.js App

- 1.1: Initialize the Next.js app (which you've done).
- 1.2: Install necessary dependencies (e.g., remark, gray-matter, etc.).
- 1.3: Set up Tailwind CSS and any required styling (done).
- 1.4: Deploy to Vercel (done).

## Step 2: Set Up Supabase for Data Storage

- 2.1: Sign up for Supabase and create a new project.
- 2.2: Create a Supabase database table for your notes:
  - Table columns: id, content (Markdown), title, tags, date, summary, etc.
- 2.3: Set up Supabase client in your Next.js app:
  - Install the @supabase/supabase-js package.
  - Initialize the Supabase client in your project.
- 2.4: Add environment variables to store your Supabase API keys.

## Step 3: Implement CRUD Functionality with Supabase

- 3.1: Create (C): Implement functionality to create new notes and store them
in Supabase.
  - Create a form for note input (title, content, tags, etc.).
  - Post the data to Supabase in Markdown format.
- 3.2: Read (R): Fetch notes from Supabase.
  - Modify your existing getAllNoteIds and getNoteById functions to query the
Supabase database instead of reading from the file system.
  - Render Markdown content as before using remark.
- 3.3: Update (U): Add the ability to edit notes.
  - Fetch existing note content, allow edits, and send updates back to Supabase.
- 3.4: Delete (D): Implement functionality to delete notes from Supabase.

## Step 4: Implement Bidirectional Linking

- 4.1: Update your Markdown parser to handle links between notes.
- 4.2: Modify Supabase schema (if needed) to store relationships between notes.
- 4.3: Update note rendering to create dynamic links to related notes.

## Step 5: Enhance UI/UX

- 5.1: Design a clean and intuitive UI for the notes list and editor.
  - Style the notes list with Tailwind, using more visually appealing components.
- 5.2: Implement a light/dark mode toggle (done).
- 5.3: Refine the Markdown renderer, ensuring a good user experience in both modes.

## Step 6: Add GPT Functionality for Notes Analysis

- 6.1: Set up GPT API to analyze your notes.
- 6.2: Implement a search/query feature where you can ask GPT questions about
your notes.
  - Feed GPT the note content retrieved from Supabase.
